# Monokai Extended for Visual Studio Code

This is a port of [Jon Schlinkert's Monokai Extended theme for Sublime Text ](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/sublime-monokai-extended).  Please note that only the main Monokai Extended theme has been ported as this is the one I have used for years in Sublime Text :)

The original theme was imported using `yo code` and converted to JSON format.  It was then adapted slightly to look beautiful and identical to Sublime Text in Visual Studio Code.  This includes removal of underlining from the original theme which was never visible in Sublime Text.

If you're interested in seeing exactly what was changed from the initial import, please run the following:

```bash
git diff -w bdbdfb0 master themes/Monokai\ Extended-color-theme.json
```

Hope you all love this colour theme as much as I have over the last few years :)
